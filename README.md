# GuardianLink: AI-Powered Phishing & Malicious URL Detector

This project is a URL classifier that uses a machine learning model to detect and classify URLs as safe, malicious, or phishing attempts. It features a simple, interactive web interface built with Streamlit for real-time analysis and prediction.

## üöÄ Features

  * **Multi-Class Classification**: Classifies URLs into three distinct categories: `safe`, `malicious`, and `phishing`.
  * **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a `RandomForestClassifier` from `scikit-learn` to identify patterns in URL structures.
  * **Interactive Web UI**: A simple and user-friendly web application built with Streamlit allows for easy, real-time URL checks.
  * **Complete Workflow**: The repository includes the dataset, model training script, and the pre-trained model file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The detection process is based on a machine learning pipeline that analyzes the lexical features of a URL.

1.  **Feature Extraction**: Each URL is converted into a set of numerical features that the model can understand. The features include:
      * Length of the URL
      * Number of dots (`.`), hyphens (`-`), and at-symbols (`@`)
      * Presence of an IP address in the domain
      * Number of subdomains
      * Presence of suspicious keywords (e.g., 'login', 'secure', 'verify', 'account', 'update')
2.  **Model Training**: The `RandomForestClassifier` is trained on the `urls.csv` dataset using these extracted features.
3.  **Prediction**: The trained model (`url_detector_model.pkl`) is loaded by the Streamlit application. When a user submits a URL, the app extracts its features and uses the model to predict its classification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

  * **Python**
  * **Scikit-learn**: For the machine learning model (`RandomForestClassifier`).
  * **Pandas**: For data manipulation and reading the CSV file.
  * **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web application.
  * **Joblib**: For saving and loading the trained model.

## üìÅ File Descriptions

  * **`app.py`**: Contains the code for the Streamlit web application that serves the model.
  * **`train_url_detector.py`**: The script used to extract features, train the `RandomForestClassifier`, and save the model to a `.pkl` file.
  * **`urls.csv`**: The dataset containing labeled URLs used for training and testing the model.
  * **`url_detector_model.pkl`**: The pre-trained, serialized machine learning model file.

## üì¶ Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

    ```
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    streamlit
    ```

    Then, run the command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Running the Web Application

1.  Ensure you have the trained model file `url_detector_model.pkl` in the root directory.
2.  Launch the Streamlit application by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

### Re-training the Model

If you modify the dataset or want to retrain the model, you can run the training script:

```bash
python train_url_detector.py
```

This will train a new model on the `urls.csv` data and overwrite the existing `url_detector_model.pkl` file.

## üìä Model Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and a detailed classification report. After running `train_url_detector.py`, the console will display the results. You can paste your results here.
